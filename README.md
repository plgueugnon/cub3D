### Overview
- Using raycasting technique recreate a 3d game in the spirit of Wolfenstein 3D
- The project is divided in two part : first parsing and detecting any error (such as a map not closed) within the .map passed as argument
- Second part : render a Wolfenstein bare-bone like game based on .map config
- Use minilibX, a graphic library derivated from OpenGL to render it visually
- At any time, user should be able to exit either using 'exit' keypad or mouse 'x' window button
- As usual per 42 standard : no memory leaks allowed (not even 'still reachable' type), and project is up to 42's coding norm
- At launch, user can generate a print screen in bitmap format by adding --save after .map argument
- Project is compatible with most linux & Mac OS recent distros
